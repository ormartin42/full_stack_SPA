 Our page is responsive. You can befriend other users in order to see additional information on their profile page (match history, stats...) but you can also ban them. There is three different levels you can chose from to play our own version of Pong. You can chose to find your opponent through a match-making system (random) or directly invite them to play though their profile page or through the Chat. Chatwise, you can create public or private channels (with or without a password) and you can mute or ban users following certain conditions.<br>
